   abstract = {Animal movements are realized by a combination of high-level control from the nervous system and joint-level movement provided by the musculoskeletal system. The digital muscle model (DMM) emulates the low-level musculoskeletal system and can be combined with a high-level artificial neural network (ANN) controller forming a hybrid control strategy. Previous work has shown that, compared to ANN-only controllers, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit similar performance with fewer synapses, suggesting that some computation is offloaded to the low-level DMM. An open question is how the complexity of the robot, in terms of the number of joints, affects the evolution of the ANN control structure. We explore this question by evolving both hybrid controllers and ANN-only controllers for worm-like animats of varying complexity. Specifically, the number of joints in the worms ranges from 1 to 12. Consistent with an earlier study, the results demonstrate that, in most cases, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit equal or better performance than ANN-only controllers. In addition, above a threshold for animat complexity (number of joints), the ANNs for one variant of the hybrid controllers have significantly fewer connections than the ANN-only controllers.}

Previous studies have shown that cooperation can nevertheless be maintained when the benefits that cooperation provides to relatives outweigh the associated costs. These fitness costs and benefits are not fixed properties, but can be affected by the environment in which populations reside. Here, we describe how one environmental factor, resource abundance, decisively affects the evolution of cooperative public goods production in two independent evolving systems. In the Avida digital evolution platform, populations evolved in environments with different levels of a required resource, while populations of Vibrio cholerae evolved in the presence of different nutrient concentrations. In both systems, cooperators and cheaters co-existed stably in resource-rich environments, while cheaters dominated in resource-poor environments. These two outcomes were separated by a sharptransition that occurred at a critical level of resource. These results offer new insights into how the environment affects the evolution of cooperation and highlight the challenges that populations of cooperators face when they experience environmental change.},

   abstract = {Adaptive controllers enable cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous robots, to manage uncertain conditions during execution. However, there is a limit to the range of conditions that can be handled by a given controller. When this limit is exceeded, a controller might fail to respond as expected, not only rendering it ineective but possibly putting the entire system at risk. In this paper, we describe a method based on evolutionary search for automatically enhancing, and discovering the boundaries of, a given adaptive controller. Collectively, these boundaries define an execution mode for that controller. Explicit specification of mode boundaries facilitates the development of decision logic that determines, based on system state and sensed conditions, when to switch to a dierent execution mode and typically a dierent controller, such as one for providing fail-safe operation. To evaluate the proposed approach, we apply it to a robotic fish propelled by a flexible caudal fin that is governed by a model-free adaptive controller. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is eective in characterizing a controllerâ€™s ability to adapt to environmental dynamics, including physical damage to the robot itself.},

As an emerging class of embedded computing system, robotic fish are anticipated to play an important role in environmental monitoring, inspection of underwater structures, tracking of hazardous wastes and oil spills, and the study of live fish behaviors. While integration of flexible materials (into the fins and/or body) holds the promise of improved swimming performance (in terms of both speed and maneuverability) for these robots, such components also introduce significant design challenges due to the complex material mechanics and hydrodynamic interactions. The problem is further exacerbated by the need for the robots to meet multiple objectives (e.g., both speed and energy efficiency). In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach to the design and control of a robotic fish with a flexible caudal fin. Specifically, we use the NSGA-II algorithm to investigate morphological and control parameter values that optimize swimming speed and power usage. Several evolved fin designs are validated experimentally with a small robotic fish, where fins of different stiffness values and sizes are printed with a multi-material 3D printer. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design approach in balancing the two competing objectives.},

However, determining the optimal control parameters for MFAC, including the structure of the underlying ANN, is a challenging process. In this paper we investigate how to enhance the online adaptability of MFAC-based systems through computational evolution. We apply the proposed methods to a simulated robotic fish propelled by a flexible caudal fin. Results demonstrate that the robot is able to effectively respond to changing fin characteristics and varying control signals when using an evolved MFAC controller. Notably, the system is able to adapt to characteristics not encountered during evolution. The proposed technique is general and can be applied to improve the adaptability of other cyber-physical systems.},

The results of these simulations reveal general principles that can be applied in the design of robotic fish morphology and control. To verify that the simulation results are physically relevant, we selected several of the evolved solutions, fabricated flexible caudal fins using a multi-material 3D printer, and attached them to a robotic fish prototype.

For comparison, we also construct a model using linear beam theory to capture the beam dynamics. To assess the accuracy of the models, we conducted experiments with a free-swimming robotic fish. The results show that the two models have almost identical predictions when the tail undergoes small deformation, but only the proposed multisegment model matches the experimental measurement closely for all tail motions, demonstrating its promise in the optimization and control of tail-actuated robotic fish.},

Individual joints are manipulated by multiple muscles acting as effectors for both movement and stabilization. We previously proposed a digital muscle model (DMM), where the morphological and control aspects of simulated joints evolve concurrently. The resulting solutions can provide insight into the evolution of natural organisms as well as possible designs for engineered systems. In this paper, we explore the integration of this model with an artificial neural network (ANN), focusing on the communication connections between the two. In the singly-connected strategy, a single ANN output is delivered to a joint; each constituent muscle responds to the signal according to an evolved function. In the individually-connected strategy, a unique ANN output is delivered to each simulated muscle. Results indicate that for low degree-of-freedom (DOF) robots, the individually-connected systems exhibit higher fitness than the singly-connnected systems. However, in larger DOF robots, the two strategies perform comparably, despite the fact that evolved ANNs for the singly-connected system are considerably simpler in terms of the number of connections in the network.},

Morphology and control are inherently intertwined. In the case of animal joints, groups of muscles work together to provide power and stability to move limbs in a coordinated manner. In contrast, many robot controllers handle both high-level planning and low-level control of individual joints. In this paper, we propose a joint-level control method, called digital muscles, that operates in a manner analogous to biological muscles, yet is abstract enough to apply to conventional robotic joints. An individual joint is controlled by multiple muscle nodes, each of which responds to a control signal according to a node-specific activation function. Evolving the physical orientation of muscle nodes and their respective activation functions enables relatively complex and coordinated gaits to be realized with simple high-level control. Even using a sinusoid as the high-level control signal, we demonstrate the evolution of effective gaits for a simulated quadruped. The proposed model realizes a control strategy for governing the behavior of individual joints, and can be coupled with a high-level controller that focuses on decision making and planning.},

  abstract =     {Bipedal hopping has evolved as a mode of terrestrial locomotion in relatively few mammalian species. Despite large differences in body size, habitat use, and having evolved independently, all species that use bipedal hopping have remarkably similar limb morphology and posture. In addition, these species all have relatively long tails, presumably to assist in maintaining stability. However, the evolution of this behavior, and specifically the role of the tail, is not well understood. In this paper, we explore the evolution of bipedal hopping in a simulated animat, using a relatively simple musculoskeletal model and a rigid-body physics simulation environment. Results indicate that characteristically different hopping gaits evolve with alterations to the morphology, including the structure and actuation of the tail. Many of the the results are consistent with behaviors and morphologies observed in natural organisms. However, in some cases effective hopping evolved despite key differences from nature, potentially inspiring new design approaches in robotic and biomechanical systems.},

  abstract =     {Developing complex behaviors for aquatic robots is a difficult engineering challenge due to the uncertainty of an underwater environment. Neuroevolution provides one method of dealing with this type of problem. Artificial neural networks discern different conditions by mapping sensory input to responses, and evolutionary computation provides a training algorithm suitable to the high dimensionality of the problem. In this paper, we present results of applying neuroevolution to an aquatic robot tasked with station keeping, that is, maintaining a given position despite surrounding water flow. The virtual device exposed to evolution is modeled after a physical counterpart that has been fabricated with a 3D printer and tested in physical environments. Evolved behaviors exhibit a variety of unexpected, complex fin/flipper movements that enable the robot to achieve and maintain station, despite water flow from different directions. Moreover, the results show that evolved controllers are able to effectively carry out this task using only information from a simulated accelerometer and gyroscope, matching the inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the actual robot.},

environment, adapt to changing conditions, and be resilient to

adaptive system is faced with a challenging set of tasks:
anticipating how and when the system will need to adapt in the
future, codifying this behavior in decision-making components to
govern the adaptation, and ensuring system integrity during and
after adaptation. These tasks are particularly difficult for
systems that must operate safely in the face of continuous
dynamics and environmental uncertainty. In the biological world,
evolution has done a remarkable job of producing systems that
adapt to their environment and survive dynamic and adverse
conditions. In this talk, we discuss preliminary investigations
and motivate future investigation for how to exploit this power

We conducted the study using digital evolution, a form of evolutionary computation where a population of computer programs (digital organisms) exists in a user-defined computational environment and is subject to instruction-level mutations and natural selection. We placed these digital organisms into groups whose fitness relied upon their ability to perform consensus. We then tested different degrees and types of genetic variation present in the population, based on biologically inspired models of gene flow, including mutation, sexual recombination, migration, and horizontal gene transfer. Our experimental treatments examined the effect of these processes on genetic variation and groups' ability to reach consensus. The results of these experiments demonstrate that while genetic heterogeneity within groups increases the difficulty of the consensus task, a surprising number of groups were able to overcome these obstacles and evolve this cooperative behavior.},

An earlier study applied a specific instance of the this model to the foraging problem. Here, we extend the system and use it to explore a fundamental question in both biology and evolutionary computation, namely, whether environmental complexity is a driving factor for an organism''s internal control structure. To address this question, we extended the original system to allow the open-ended evolution of the unique programs, instructions, and threads within each controller. With the extended model, we were able to evolve successful foraging strategies that nearly doubled the performance of strategies found in the earlier work. In response to increasing environmental complexity, we discovered a high degree of variation for the number of programs, threads, and instructions that produced successful strategies. These results imply that environmental complexity does not require evolutionary search methods to explore regions of the search space characterized by parallel and distributed control. However, strategies found within these regions were as successful as strategies governed by a single program and thread, highlighting the importance of evolutionary search techniques that enable the open-ended evolution of key internal control components.},

Bacteria use QS to trigger secretion of digestive enzymes, formation and destruction of biofilms, and, in the case of pathogenic organisms, expression of virulence factors that cause disease. Investigations of mechanisms that prevent or disrupt QS, referred to as quorum quenching, are of interest because they provide a new alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. Traditional antibiotics either kill bacteria or inhibit their growth, producing selective pressures that promote resistant strains. In contrast, quorum quenching and other so-called anti-infective strategies focus on altering behavior. In this article we evolve QS in populations of digital organisms, a type of self-replicating computer program, and investigate the effects of quorum quenching on these populations. Specifically, we injected the populations with mutant organisms that were impaired in selected ways to disrupt the QS process. The experimental results indicate that the rate at which these mutants are introduced into a population influences both the evolvability of QS and the persistence of an existing QS behavior. Surprisingly, we also observed resistance to quorum quenching. Effectively, populations evolved resistance by reaching quorum at lower cell densities than did the parent strain. Moreover, the level of resistance was highest when the rate of mutant introduction increased over time. These results show that digital organisms can serve as a model to study the evolution and disruption of QS, potentially informing wet-lab studies aimed at identifying targets for anti-infective development.},

A DAS, especially one intertwined with physical elements, must increasingly reason about and cope with unpredictable events in its execution environment. Unfortunately, it is often infeasible for a human to exhaustively explore, anticipate, or resolve all possible system and environmental conditions that a DAS will encounter as it executes. While uncertainty can be difficult to define, its effects can hinder the adaptation capabilities of a DAS. The concept of uncertainty has been extensively explored by other scientific disciplines, such as economics, physics, and psychology. As such, the software engineering DAS community can benefit from leveraging, reusing, and refining such knowledge for developing a DAS. By synthesizing uncertainty concepts from other disciplines, this paper revisits the concept of uncertainty from the perspective of a DAS, proposes a taxonomy of potential sources of uncertainty at the requirements, design, and execution phases, and identifies existing techniques for mitigating specific types of uncertainty. This paper also introduces a template for describing different types of uncertainty, including fields such as source, occurrence, impact, and mitigating strategies. We use this template to describe each type of uncertainty and illustrate the uncertainty source in terms of an example DAS application from the intelligent vehicle systems (IVS) domain.},

Here, we use neuroevolution to study a generic coverage-based problem, where agents in the network are to maximize the area covered by the largest connected component of the network. An example application for this work is the discovery of control algorithms for an ocean-monitoring mobile network. While this is a challenging problem domain for neuroevolution, results of our experiments reveal three important characteristics to be considered when using such an approach. Specifically, we found that approaches that implicitly reduce entropy, while explicitly addressing self-organization and scalability, are capable of discovering behaviors that remain stable even when they control networks of different sizes than were evaluated during evolution. This result suggests that neuroevolution may be a viable strategy for discovering controllers for self-organizing multi-agent systems.},
