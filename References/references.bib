	Abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

@article{Jindrich2002,
	Abstract = {To stabilize locomotion, animals must generate forces appropriate to
overcome the effects of perturbations and to maintain a desired speed or
direction of movement. We studied the stabilizing mechanism employed by
rapidly running insects by using a novel apparatus to perturb running
cockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis). The apparatus used chemical
propellants to accelerate a small projectile, generating reaction force
impulses of less than 10 ms duration. The apparatus was mounted onto the
thorax of the insect, oriented to propel the projectile laterally and loaded
with propellant sufficient to cause a nearly tenfold increase in lateral
velocity relative to maxima observed during unperturbed locomotion.
Cockroaches were able to recover from these perturbations in 27$\pm$12 ms
(mean $\pm$ S.D., N=9) when running on a high-friction substratum.
Lateral velocity began to decrease 13$\pm$5 ms (mean $\pm$ S.D.,
N=11) following the start of a perturbation, a time comparable with
the fastest reflexes measured in cockroaches. Cockroaches did not require step
transitions to recover from lateral perturbations. Instead, they exhibited
viscoelastic behavior in the lateral direction, with spring constants similar
to those observed during unperturbed locomotion. The rapid onset of recovery
from lateral perturbations supports the possibility that, during fast
locomotion, intrinsic properties of the musculoskeletal system augment neural
stabilization by reflexes.},

@article{McMahon1985,
	Abstract = {The running gaits used by both bipedal and quadrupedal animals are reviewed and contrasted. At high speeds, bipeds use both ordinary running, in which the legs move opposite one another, and hopping. Quadrupeds generally use the trot or its variations at moderate speeds, and first the canter and then the gallop as speed increases. Running in both bipeds and quadrupeds generally involves at least one aerial phase per stride cycle, but certain perturbations to running including running in circles, running under enhanced gravity, running on compliant surfaces and running with increased knee flexion (Groucho running) can reduce the aerial phase, even to zero. A conceptual model of running based on the idea that an animal rebounds from the ground like a resonant mass-spring system may be used to compare the various gaits. The model makes specific predictions which show that galloping is generally faster than cantering, pronking or trotting, and requires lower peak vertical forces on the legs while also giving a smoother ride. Even so, trotting might be preferred to galloping at low and moderate speeds for the same reason that normal running is preferred to Groucho running-the more compliant gait offers a smoother ride and lower vertical ground-reaction forces on the feet, but this can only be obtained at a high cost of increased metabolic power.},

@article{Herr2000,
	Abstract = {A new control strategy is used to stabilize numerical simulations of a horse model in                 the trotting quadrupedal gait. Several well-established experimental findings are                 predicted by the model, including how stride frequency and stride length change with                 forward running speed. Mass is distributed throughout the model's legs, trunk, and                 head in a realistic manner. Leg and trunk flexion is modeled using four flexible                 legs, a back joint, and a neck joint. In the control model, pitch stabilization is                 achieved without directly controlling body pitch, but rather by controlling both the                 aerial time and the foot speed of each stance leg. The legs behave as ideal springs                 while in contact with the ground, enabling the model to rebound from the ground with                 each trotting step. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the model's capacity                 to overcome a change in ground impedance. Model stability is maximized and the                 metabolic cost of trotting is minimized within a narrow range of leg stiffness where                 trotting horses of similar body size have been observed to operate. This work                 suggests that a horselike robot will exhibit behavior that is mechanically similar                 to that of a trotting horse if it operates in a narrow range of leg stiffness and                 employs simple control strategies where postural stabilization is an emergent                 property of the system.},

@article{Lee2005,
	Abstract = {Limb design is well conserved among quadrupeds, notably, the knees point forward (i.e. cranial inclination of femora) and the elbows point back (i.e. caudal inclination of humeri). This study was undertaken to examine the effects of joint orientation on individual leg forces and centre of mass dynamics. Steady-speed trotting was simulated in two quadrupedal models. Model I had the knee and elbow orientation of a quadruped and model II had a reversed leg configuration in which knees point back and elbows point forward. The model's legs showed directional compliance determined by the orientation of the knee/elbow. In both models, forward pointing knees/elbows produced a propulsive force bias, while rearward pointing knees/elbows produced a braking force bias. Hence, model I showed the same pattern of hind-leg propulsion and fore-leg braking observed in trotting animals. Simulations revealed minimal pitch oscillations during steady-speed trotting of model I, but substantially greater and more irregular pitch oscillations of model II. The reduced pitch oscillation of model I was a result of fore-leg and hind-leg forces that reduced pitching moments during early and late stance, respectively. This passive mechanism for reducing pitch oscillations was an emergent property of directionally compliant legs with the fore--hind configuration of model I. Such intrinsic stability resulting from mechanical design can simplify control tasks and lead to more robust running machines.},

At high speeds, men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion.It is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores. Analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee. The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.Though the evidence presented in this paper comes mainly from a few species, the conclusions presumably apply to large mammals in general.},

@article{Alexander1988,
	Abstract = {Most mammals use symmetrical gaits (such as the trot) at moderate speeds but change to asymmetrical gaits (gallops) at high speeds. A mathematical model of quadrupedal gaits failed to show any advantage in this change: it seemed to show that, even at high speeds, there was always a symmetrical gait that was at least as economical as galloping. That model treated the back as rigid, but another model seemed to show that back movements such as occur in galloping could only increase the energy cost. However, metabolic measurements on horses showed that galloping is more economical than trotting at high speeds. The explanation seems to be that kinetic energy fluctuations, due to backward and forward swinging of the legs, become very large at high speeds. Galloping makes it possible for kinetic energy associated with leg movements to be stored briefly as strain energy in elastic structures in the back, and returned in an elastic recoil. The most important of the strain energy stores in the back, that have been discovered so far, is the aponeurosis of the longissimus muscle.},

	Abstract = {Running-specific prostheses (RSF) are designed to replicate the spring-like nature of biological legs (bioL) during running. However, it is not clear how these devices affect whole leg stiffness characteristics or running dynamics over a range of speeds. We used a simple spring-mass model to examine running mechanics across a range of speeds, in unilateral and bilateral transtibial amputees and performance-matched controls. We found significant differences between the affected leg (AL) of unilateral amputees and both ALs of bilateral amputees compared with the bioL of non-amputees for nearly every variable measured. Leg stiffness remained constant or increased with speed in bioL, but decreased with speed in legs with RSPs. The decrease in leg stiffness in legs with RSPs was mainly owing to a combination of lower peak ground reaction forces and increased leg compression with increasing speeds. Leg stiffness is an important parameter affecting contact time and the force exerted on the ground. It is likely that the fixed stiffness of the prosthesis coupled with differences in the limb posture required to run with the prosthesis limits the ability to modulate whole leg stiffness and the ability to apply high vertical ground reaction forces during sprinting.},

@article{Ruina2005,
	Abstract = {Terrestrial legged locomotion requires repeated support forces to redirect the body's vertical velocity component from down to up. We assume that the redirection is accomplished by impulsive leg forces that cause small-angle glancing collisions of a point-mass model of the animal. We estimate the energetic costs of these collisions by assuming a metabolic cost proportional to positive muscle work involved in generating the impulses. The cost of bipedal running estimated from this collisional model becomes less than that of walking at a Froude number (v2/gl) of about 0.7. Two strategies to reduce locomotion costs associated with the motion redirection are: (1) having legs simulate purely elastic springs, as is observed in human running; and (2) sequencing the leg forces during the redirection phase; examples of this sequencing are the ba-da-dump pattern of a horse gallop and having push-off followed by heel-strike in human walking.},

	Abstract = {The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring--mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},

@article{Cavagna1977,
	Abstract = {The work done during each step to lift and to reaccelerate (in the forward direction) and center of mass has been measured during locomotion in bipeds (rhea and turkey), quadrupeds (dogs, stump-tailed macaques, and ram), and hoppers (kangaroo and springhare). Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70% of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30% to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic "bounce" of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

	Abstract = {As one of the most energetically demanding daily activities, locomotion has attracted substantial investigative attention. Although legged locomotion has been well described, it is currently not well understood. Looking at energy accounting might be a good pathway with which to solve this problem. One relatively simple way of analyzing energy management is to look directly at the flow of mechanical energy into and out of the system, in terms of costs and losses (with some attention to the mechanisms responsible for this flow). In this commentary we argue that a key source of energetic loss has largely been neglected: the redirection of body motion from downward to upward at each step. We discuss the role of this loss and the compensating energetic costs, identifying some of the general features of the trade-offs that determine gait optimization strategies. We find that even at a conceptual level, a focus on the main mechanism of loss and the strategies available to the organism to effectively compensate for losses can yield substantial insight into observations as diverse as the functional limits of a playground swing through to the strikingly different effect of reduced gravity on human walking and running. Such insight changes the interpretation of fundamental features of leg function, such as push-off timing and the role of elastic deflection during stance.},

	Abstract = {The development of functional legged robots has encountered its limits in human-made actuation technology. This paper describes research on the biomimetic design of legs for agile quadrupeds. A biomimetic leg concept that extracts key principles from horse legs which are responsible for the agile and powerful locomotion of these animals is presented. The proposed biomimetic leg model defines the effective leg length, leg kinematics, limb mass distribution, actuator power, and elastic energy recovery as determinants of agile locomotion, and values for these five key elements are given. The transfer of the extracted principles to technological instantiations is analyzed in detail, considering the availability of current materials, structures and actuators. A real leg prototype has been developed following the biomimetic leg concept proposed. The actuation system is based on the hybrid use of series elasticity and magneto-rheological dampers which provides variable compliance for natural motion. From the experimental evaluation of this prototype, conclusions on the current technological barriers to achieve real functional legged robots to walk dynamically in agile locomotion are presented.},

@article{cm50,
	Abstract = {Mechanical stresses (force/cross-sectional area) acting in muscles, tendons and bones of the hindlimbs of kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) were calculated during steady-speed hops and vertical jumps. Stresses were determined from both high-speed cine films (light and X-ray) and force plate recordings, as well as from in vivo tendon force recordings. Stresses in each hindlimb support element during hopping (1.6-3.1 m s-1) were generally only 33% of those acting during jumping (greater than or equal to 40 cm height): ankle extensor muscles, 80 +/- 12 (S.D.) versus 297 +/- 42 kPa; ankle extensor tendons, 7.9 +/- 1.5 versus 32.7 +/- 4.8 MPa; tibia, -29 +/- 5 versus -110 +/- 25 MPa (all values are for hopping versus jumping). The magnitude of stress in each structure during these locomotor activities was similarly matched to the strength of each element, so that a consistent safety factor to failure is achieved for the hindlimb as a whole (1.5-2.0). The large stresses during jumping were correlated with a three-fold increase in ground reaction forces exerted on the ground compared with the fastest steady hopping speeds. We conclude that, for its size, the kangaroo rat has disproportionately large hindlimb muscles, tendons and bones to withstand the large forces associated with rapid acceleration to avoid predation, which limits their ability to store and recover elastic strain energy. Middle ear morphology and behavioural observations of kangaroo rats jumping vertically to avoid predation by owls and rattlesnakes support this view.},

@article{Sellers2003,
	Abstract = {To understand the evolution of bipedalism among the hominoids in an
ecological context we need to be able to estimate the energetic cost of
locomotion in fossil forms. Ideally such an estimate would be based entirely
on morphology since, except for the rare instances where footprints are
preserved, this is the only primary source of evidence available. In this
paper we use evolutionary robotics techniques (genetic algorithms, pattern
generators and mechanical modeling) to produce a biomimetic simulation of
bipedalism based on human body dimensions. The mechanical simulation is a
seven-segment, two-dimensional model with motive force provided by tension
generators representing the major muscle groups acting around the lower-limb
joints. Metabolic energy costs are calculated from the muscle model, and
bipedal gait is generated using a finite-state pattern generator whose
parameters are produced using a genetic algorithm with locomotor economy
(maximum distance for a fixed energy cost) as the fitness criterion. The model
is validated by comparing the values it generates with those for modern
humans. The result (maximum efficiency of 200 J m--1) is
within 15% of the experimentally derived value, which is very encouraging and
suggests that this is a useful analytic technique for investigating the
locomotor behaviour of fossil forms. Initial work suggests that in the future
this technique could be used to estimate other locomotor parameters such as
top speed. In addition, the animations produced by this technique are
qualitatively very convincing, which suggests that this may also be a useful
technique for visualizing bipedal locomotion.},

@article{Sellers2005,
	Abstract = {This paper uses techniques from evolutionary robotics to predict the most energy-efficient upright walking gait for the early human relative Australopithecus afarensis, based on the proportions of the 3.2 million year old AL 288-1 `Lucy' skeleton, and matches predictions against the nearly contemporaneous (3.5--3.6 million year old) Laetoli fossil footprint trails. The technique creates gaits de novo and uses genetic algorithm optimization to search for the most efficient patterns of simulated muscular contraction at a variety of speeds. The model was first verified by predicting gaits for living human subjects, and comparing costs, stride lengths and speeds to experimentally determined values for the same subjects. Subsequent simulations for A. afarensis yield estimates of the range of walking speeds from 0.6 to 1.3 m s−1 at a cost of 7.0 J kg−1 m−1 for the lowest speeds, falling to 5.8 J kg−1 m−1 at 1.0 m s−1, and rising to 6.2 J kg−1 m−1 at the maximum speed achieved. Speeds previously estimated for the makers of the Laetoli footprint trails (0.56 or 0.64 m s−1 for Trail 1, 0.72 or 0.75 m s−1 for Trail 2/3) may have been underestimated, substantially so for Trail 2/3, with true values in excess of 0.7 and 1.0 m s−1, respectively. The predictions conflict with suggestions that A. afarensis used a `shuffling' gait, indicating rather that the species was a fully competent biped.},

Energy storage and exchange mechanisms discovered in walking and running bipeds apply to multilegged locomotion and even to flying and swimming. Nonpropulsive lateral forces can be sizable, but they may benefit stability, maneuverability, or other criteria that become apparent in natural environments. Locomotor control systems combine rapid mechanical preflexes with multimodal sensory feedback and feedforward commands. Muscles have a surprising variety of functions in locomotion, serving as motors, brakes, springs, and struts. Integrative approaches reveal not only how each component within a locomotor system operates but how they function as a collective whole.},

@article{Nishikawa2007,
	Abstract = {Neuromechanics seeks to understand how muscles, sense organs, motor pattern generators, and brain interact to produce coordinated movement, not only in complex terrain but also when confronted with unexpected perturbations. Applications of neuromechanics include ameliorating human health problems (including prosthesis design and restoration of movement following brain or spinal cord injury), as well as the design, actuation and control of mobile robots. In animals, coordinated movement emerges from the interplay among descending output from the central nervous system, sensory input from body and environment, muscle dynamics, and the emergent dynamics of the whole animal. The inevitable coupling between neural information processing and the emergent mechanical behavior of animals is a central theme of neuromechanics. Fundamentally, motor control involves a series of transformations of information, from brain and spinal cord to muscles to body, and back to brain. The control problem revolves around the specific transfer functions that describe each transformation. The transfer functions depend on the rules of organization and operation that determine the dynamic behavior of each subsystem (i.e., central processing, force generation, emergent dynamics, and sensory processing). In this review, we (1) consider the contributions of muscles, (2) sensory processing, and (3) central networks to motor control, (4) provide examples to illustrate the interplay among brain, muscles, sense organs and the environment in the control of movement, and (5) describe advances in both robotics and neuromechanics that have emerged from application of biological principles in robotic design. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that (1) intrinsic properties of muscle contribute to dynamic stability and control of movement, particularly immediately after perturbations; (2) proprioceptive feedback reinforces these intrinsic self-stabilizing properties of muscle; (3) control systems must contend with inevitable time delays that can simplify or complicate control; and (4) like most animals under a variety of circumstances, some robots use a trial and error process to tune central feedforward control to emergent body dynamics.},

@article{Daley2009,
	Abstract = {Here we investigate the interplay between intrinsic mechanical and neural factors in muscle contractile performance during running, which has been less studied than during walking. We report in vivo recordings of the gastrocnemius muscle of the guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), during the response and recovery from an unexpected drop in terrain. Previous studies on leg and joint mechanics following this perturbation suggested that distal leg extensor muscles play a key role in stabilisation. Here, we test this through direct recordings of gastrocnemius fascicle length (using sonomicrometry), muscle-tendon force (using buckle transducers), and activity (using indwelling EMG). Muscle recordings were analysed from the stride just before to the second stride following the perturbation. The gastrocnemius exhibits altered force and work output in the perturbed and first recovery strides. Muscle work correlates strongly with leg posture at the time of ground contact. When the leg is more extended in the drop step, net gastrocnemius work decreases (-5.2 J kg(-1) versus control), and when the leg is more flexed in the step back up, it increases (+9.8 J kg(-1) versus control). The muscle's work output is inherently stabilising because it pushes the body back toward its pre-perturbation (level running) speed and leg posture. Gastrocnemius length and force return to level running means by the second stride following the perturbation. EMG intensity differs significantly from level running only in the first recovery stride following the perturbation, not within the perturbed stride. The findings suggest that intrinsic mechanical factors contribute substantially to the initial changes in muscle force and work. The statistical results suggest that a history-dependent effect, shortening deactivation, may be an important factor in the intrinsic mechanical changes, in addition to instantaneous force-velocity and force-length effects. This finding suggests the potential need to incorporate history-dependent muscle properties into neuromechanical simulations of running, particularly if high muscle strains are involved and stability characteristics are important. Future work should test whether a Hill or modified Hill type model provides adequate prediction in such conditions. Interpreted in light of previous studies on walking, the findings support the concept of speed-dependent roles of reflex feedback.},

@article{Gerritsen1998,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate, theoretically, to what extent muscle properties could contribute to recovery from perturbations during locomotion. Four models with different actuator properties were created: the FLVT model, which encompassed force-length (FL) and force-velocity (FV) characteristics of human muscles as well as muscle stimulation inputs as functions of time (T); the FLT model, which had muscles without force-velocity characteristics; the FVT model, which had muscles without specific force-length characteristics; and the MT model, which had no muscles but was driven by joint moments (M) as a function of time. Each model was exposed to static and dynamic perturbations and its response was examined. FLVT showed good resistance to both static can dynamic perturbations. FLT was resistant to static perturbation but could not counteract dynamic perturbation, whereas the opposite was found for FVT. MT could not counteract either of the perturbations. Based on the results of the simulations, skeletal muscle force-length-velocity properties, although interactively complex, contribute substantially to the dynamic stability of the musculoskeletal system.},

@article{Katz2011,
	Abstract = {The complexity of nervous systems alters the evolvability of behaviour. Complex nervous systems are phylogenetically constrained; nevertheless particular species-specific behaviours have repeatedly evolved, suggesting a predisposition towards those behaviours. Independently evolved behaviours in animals that share a common neural architecture are generally produced by homologous neural structures, homologous neural pathways and even in the case of some invertebrates, homologous identified neurons. Such parallel evolution has been documented in the chromatic sensitivity of visual systems, motor behaviours and complex social behaviours such as pair-bonding. The appearance of homoplasious behaviours produced by homologous neural substrates suggests that there might be features of these nervous systems that favoured the repeated evolution of particular behaviours. Neuromodulation may be one such feature because it allows anatomically defined neural circuitry to be re-purposed. The developmental, genetic and physiological mechanisms that contribute to nervous system complexity may also bias the evolution of behaviour, thereby affecting the evolvability of species-specific behaviour.},

Here we present three robots based on passive-dynamics, with small active power sources substituted for gravity, which can walk on level ground. These robots use less control and less energy than other powered robots, yet walk more naturally, further suggesting the importance of passive-dynamics in human locomotion.},

@article{Neptune2011,
	Abstract = {Walking is a complex dynamic task that requires the regulation of whole-body angular momentum to maintain dynamic balance while performing walking subtasks such as propelling the body forward and accelerating the leg into swing. In human walking, the primary mechanism to regulate angular momentum is muscle force generation. Muscles accelerate body segments and generate ground reaction forces that alter angular momentum about the body's center-of-mass to restore and maintain dynamic stability. In addition, gravity contributes to whole-body angular momentum through its contribution to the ground reaction forces. The purpose of this study was to generate a muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulation of normal walking to quantify how individual muscles and gravity contribute to whole-body angular momentum in the sagittal plane. In early stance, the uniarticular hip and knee extensors (GMAX and VAS), biarticular hamstrings (HAM) and ankle dorsiflexors (TA) generated backward angular momentum while the ankle plantar flexors (SOL and GAS) generated forward momentum. In late stance, SOL and GAS were the primary contributors and generated angular momentum in opposite directions. SOL generated primarily forward angular momentum while GAS generated backward angular momentum. The difference between muscles was due to their relative contributions to the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces. Gravity contributed to the body's angular momentum in early stance and to a lesser extent in late stance, which was counteracted primarily by the plantar flexors. These results may provide insight into balance and movement disorders and provide a basis for developing locomotor therapies that target specific muscle groups.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial arthropods negotiate demanding terrain more effectively than any search-and-rescue robot. Slow, precise stepping using distributed neural feedback is one strategy for dealing with challenging terrain. Alternatively, arthropods could simplify control on demanding surfaces by rapid running that uses kinetic energy to bridge gaps between footholds. We demonstrate that this is achieved using distributed mechanical feedback, resulting from passive contacts along legs positioned by pre-programmed trajectories favorable to their attachment mechanisms. We used wire-mesh experimental surfaces to determine how a decrease in foothold probability affects speed and stability. Spiders and insects attained high running speeds on simulated terrain with 90% of the surface contact area removed. Cockroaches maintained high speeds even with their tarsi ablated, by generating horizontally oriented leg trajectories. Spiders with more vertically directed leg placement used leg spines, which resulted in more effective distributed contact by interlocking with asperities during leg extension, but collapsing during flexion, preventing entanglement. Ghost crabs, which naturally lack leg spines, showed increased mobility on wire mesh after the addition of artificial, collapsible spines. A bioinspired robot, RHex, was redesigned to maximize effective distributed leg contact, by changing leg orientation and adding directional spines. These changes improved RHex's agility on challenging surfaces without adding sensors or changing the control system.},

	Abstract = {Geckos have evolved one of the most versatile and effective adhesives known. The mechanism of dry adhesion in the millions of setae on the toes of geckos has been the focus of scientific study for over a century. We provide the first direct experimental evidence for dry adhesion of gecko setae by van der Waals forces, and reject the use of mechanisms relying on high surface polarity, including capillary adhesion. The toes of live Tokay geckos were highly hydrophobic, and adhered equally well to strongly hydrophobic and strongly hydrophilic, polarizable surfaces. Adhesion of a single isolated gecko seta was equally effective on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of a microelectro-mechanical systems force sensor. A van der Waals mechanism implies that the remarkable adhesive properties of gecko setae are merely a result of the size and shape of the tips, and are not strongly affected by surface chemistry. Theory predicts greater adhesive forces simply from subdividing setae to increase surface density, and suggests a possible design principle underlying the repeated, convergent evolution of dry adhesive microstructures in gecko, anoles, skinks, and insects. Estimates using a standard adhesion model and our measured forces come remarkably close to predicting the tip size of Tokay gecko seta. We verified the dependence on size and not surface type by using physical models of setal tips nanofabricated from two different materials. Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted and provide a path to manufacturing the first dry, adhesive microstructures.},

	Abstract = {{
                A central tenet in evolutionary theory is that mutations occur randomly with respect to their value to an organism; selection then governs whether they are fixed in a population. This principle has been challenged by long-standing theoretical models predicting that selection could modulate the rate of mutation itself. However, our understanding of how the mutation rate varies between different sites within a genome has been hindered by technical difficulties in measuring it. Here we present a study that overcomes previous limitations by combining phylogenetic and population genetic techniques. Upon comparing 34 Escherichia coli genomes, we observe that the neutral mutation rate varies by more than an order of magnitude across 2,659 genes, with mutational hot and cold spots spanning several kilobases. Importantly, the variation is not random: we detect a lower rate in highly expressed genes and in those undergoing stronger purifying selection. Our observations suggest that the mutation rate has been evolutionarily optimized to reduce the risk of deleterious mutations. Current knowledge of factors influencing the mutation rate-including transcription-coupled repair and context-dependent mutagenesis-do not explain these observations, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved. The findings have important implications for our understanding of evolution and the control of mutations.

	Abstract = {<B>Abstract</B><P></P>With advances in actuation and sensing materials and devices, there is a growing interest in developing underwater robots that propel and maneuver themselves as real fish do. Such robots, often known as robotic fish, could provide an engineering tool for understanding fish swimming. Equipped with communication capabilities and sensors, they could also serve as economical, dynamic samplers of aquatic environments. In this paper we discuss some of the major challenges in realizing adaptive, cost-effective, mobile sensor networks that are enabled by resource-constrained robotic fish. Such challenges include maneuvering in the presence of ambient disturbances, localization with adequate precision, sustained operation with minimal human interference, and cooperative control and sensing under communication constraints. We also present potential solutions and promising research directions for addressing these challenges, some of which are inspired by how fish solve similar problems.},

	Abstract = {Geckos are nature's elite climbers. Their remarkable climbing feats have been attributed to specialized feet with hairy toes that uncurl and peel in milliseconds. Here, we report that the secret to the gecko's arboreal acrobatics includes an active tail. We examine the tail's role during rapid climbing, aerial descent, and gliding. We show that a gecko's tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to a bicycle's kickstand. Should a gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Biologists have long debated whether ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny and, if so, why. Two plausible explanations are that (i) changes to early developmental stages are selected against because they tend to disrupt later development and (ii) simpler structures often precede more complex ones in both ontogeny and phylogeny if the former serve as building blocks for the latter. It is difficult to test these hypotheses experimentally in natural systems, so we used a computational system that exhibits evolutionary dynamics. We observed that ontogeny does indeed recapitulate phylogeny; traits that arose earlier in a lineage's history also tended to be expressed earlier in the development of individuals. The relative complexity of traits contributed substantially to this correlation, but a significant tendency toward recapitulation remained even after accounting for trait complexity. This additional effect provides evidence that selection against developmental disruption also contributed to the conservation of early stages in development.},

Further symbolism is introduced to take care of branching filaments as well. Two entirely different models are constructed for a particular branching organism, resembling one of the red algae. These models are compared with reference to the number of states employed, and the presence or absence of instructions for unequal divisions and for inductive relationships among the cells. The importance of a morphogenetic control theory concerning these relationships is emphasized.}},

@article{Alon2005,
	Abstract = {{Biological networks have an inherent simplicity: they are modular with a design that can be separated into units that perform almost independently. Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such  '' modularly varying goals'' lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.}},

	Abstract = {A methodology for evolving the control systems of
                 autonomous robots has not yet been well established. In
                 this paper we will show different examples of
                 applications of evolutionary robotics to real robots by
                 describing three different approaches to develop neural
                 controllers for mobile robots. In all the experiments
                 described real robots are involved and are indeed the
                 ultimate means of evaluating the success and the results
                 of the procedures employed. Each approach will be
                 compared with the others and the relative advantages and
                 drawbacks will be discussed. Last, but not least, we will
                 try to tackle a few important issues related to the
                 design of the hardware and of the evolutionary conditions
                 in which the control system of the autonomous agent
                 should evolve.},

@article{Lipson2000,
	Abstract = {Biological life is in control of its own means of reproduction, which generally involves complex, autocatalysing chemical reactions. But this autonomy of design and manufacture has not yet been realized artificially. Robots are still laboriously designed and constructed by teams of human engineers, usually at considerable expense. Few robots are available because these costs must be absorbed through mass production, which is justified only for toys, weapons and industrial systems such as automatic teller machines. Here we report the results of a combined computational and experimental approach in which simple electromechanical systems are evolved through simulations from basic building blocks (bars, actuators and artificial neurons); the 'fittest' machines (defined by their locomotive ability) are then fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology. We thus achieve autonomy of design and construction using evolution in a 'limited universe' physical simulation coupled to automatic fabrication.},

	Abstract = {The Draper Laboratory Vorticity Control Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (VCUUV) is the first mission-scale, autonomous underwater vehicle that uses vorticity control propulsion and maneuvering. Built as a research platform with which to study the energetics and maneuvering performance of fish-swimming propulsion, the VCUUV is a self-contained free swimming research vehicle which follows the morphology and kinematics of a yellowfin tuna. The forward half of the vehicle is comprised of a rigid hull which houses batteries, electronics, ballast and hydraulic power unit. The aft section is a freely flooded articulated robot tail which is terminated with a lunate caudal fin. Utilizing experimentally optimized body and tail kinematics from the MIT Robo Tuna, the VCUUV has demonstrated stable steady swimming speeds up to 1.2 m/sec and aggressive maneuvering trajectories with turning rates up to 75 degrees per second. This paper summarizes the vehicle maneuvering and stability performance observed in field trials and compares the results to predicted performance using theoretical and empirical techniques.},

	Abstract = {The elongated-body theory of the reactive forces on a fish moving in water (that is, forces resulting from the inertia of associated water movements) is extended so that a prediction of instantaneous reactive force between fish and water is obtained for fish motions of arbitrary amplitude, regular or irregular (secion 2). A preliminary application of the theory to the balance of reactive thrust and resistive drag in regular carangiform swimming of fishes with slender caudal fins is made (section 3). Comparison with data (Bainbridge 1963) on the dace Leuciscus suggests that an important feature of this balance may be a substantial enhancement of drag for such fishes when swimming movements commence, an enhancement here interpreted in terms of a boundary-layer-thinning mechanism first suggested by Dr Quentin Bone.},

	Abstract = {{We discuss the methodological foundations for our work on the development of cognitive architectures, or control systems, for situated autonomous agents. Our focus is the problems of developing sensorimotor control systems for mobile robots, but we also discuss the applicability of our approach to the study of biological systems. We argue that, for agents required to exhibit sophisticated interactions with their environments, complex sensorimotor processing is necessary, and the design, by hand, of control systems capable of such processing is likely to become prohibitively difficult as complexity increases. We propose an automatic design process involving artificial evolution, wherein the basic building blocks used for evolving cognitive architectures are noise-tolerant dynamical neural networks. These networks may be recurrent and should operate in real time. The evolution should be incremental, using an extended and modified version of a genetic algorithm.  Practical constraints suggest that initial architecture evaluations should be done largely in simulation. To support our claims and proposals, we summarize results from some preliminary simulation experiments in which visually guided robots are evolved to operate in simple environments. Significantly, our results demonstrate that robust visually guided control systems evolve from evaluation functions that do not explicitly require monitoring visual input. We outline the difficulties involved in continuing with simulations and conclude by describing specialized visuorobotic equipment, designed to eliminate the need for simulated sensors and actuators. 10.1177/105971239300200104}},

	Abstract = {Automatically synthesizing behaviors for robots with articulated bodies poses a number of challenges beyond those encountered when generating behaviors for simpler agents. One such challenge is how to optimize a controller that can orchestrate dynamic motion of different parts of the body at different times. This paper presents an incremental shaping method that addresses this challenge: it trains a controller to both coordinate a robot's leg motions to achieve directed locomotion toward an object, and then coordinate gripper motion to achieve lifting once the object is reached. It is shown that success is dependent on the order in which these behaviors are learned, and that despite the fact that one robot can master these behaviors better than another with a different morphology, this learning order is invariant across the two robot morphologies investigated here. This suggests that aspects of the task environment, learning algorithm or the controller dictate learning order more than the choice of morphology.},

	Abstract = {Karl Sims' work on evolving body shapes and controllers for three-dimensional, physically simulated creatures generated wide interest on its publication in 1994. The purpose of this article is threefold: (a) to highlight a spate of recent work by a number of researchers in replicating, and in some cases extending, Sims' results using standard PCs (Sims' original work was done on a Connection Machine CM-5 parallel computer). In particular, a re-implementation of Sims' work by the authors will be described and discussed; (b) to illustrate how off-the-shelf physics engines can be used in this sort of work, and also to highlight some deficiencies of these engines and pitfalls when using them; and (c) to indicate how these recent studies stand in respect to Sims' original work.},

@article{Ijspeert2001,
	Abstract = {This article investigates the neural mechanisms underlying salamander locomotion, and develops a biologically plausible connectionist model of a central pattern generator capable of producing the typical aquatic and terrestrial gaits of the salamander. It investigates, in particular, what type of neural circuitry can produce and modulate the two locomotor programs identified within the salamander's spinal cord; namely, a traveling wave of neural activity for swimming and a standing wave for trotting. A two-dimensional biomechanical simulation of the salamander's body is developed whose muscle contraction is determined by the locomotion controller simulated as a leaky-integrator neural network. While the connectivity of the neural circuitry underlying locomotion in the salamander has not been decoded for the moment, this article presents the design of a neural circuit that has a general organization corresponding to that hypothesized by neurobiologists. In particular, the locomotion controller is based on a body central pattern generator (CPG) corresponding to a lamprey-like swimming controller, and is extended with a limb CPG for controlling the salamander's limbs. The complete controller is developed in three stages: first the development of segmental oscillators, second the development of intersegmental coupling for the making of a lamprey-like swimming CPG, and finally the development of the limb CPG and its coupling to the body CPG. A genetic algorithm is used to determine the parameters of the neural circuit for the different stages, given a high-level description of the desired state space trajectories of the different subnetworks. A controller is thus developed that can produce neural activities and locomotion gaits very similar to those observed in the real salamander. By varying the tonic (i.e. non-oscillating) excitation applied to the network, the speed, direction and type of gait can be varied.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary robotics has been shown to be an effective technique for generating robot behaviors that are dif- ficult to derive analytically from the robot's mechanics and task environment. Moreover, augmenting evolutionary algorithms with environmental scaffolding via an incremental shaping method makes it possible to evolve controllers for complex tasks that would otherwise be infeasible. In this paper we present a summary of two recent publications in the evolutionary robotics literature demonstrating how these methods can be used to evolve robot controllers for non-trivial tasks, what the obstacles are in evolving controllers in this way, and present a novel research question that can be investigated under this framework.},

@inproceedings{Mazzapioda2009,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present a model which allows to co-evolve the morphology and the control system of realistically simulated robots (creatures). The method proposed is based on an artificial ontogenetic process in which the genotype does not specify directly the characteristics of the creatures but rather the growing rules that determine how an initial artificial embryo will develop on a fully formed individual. More specifically, the creatures are generated through a developmental process which occurs in time and space and which is realized through the progressive addition of both structural parts and regulatory substances which affect the successive course of the morphogenetic process. The creatures are provided with a distributed control system made up of several independent neural controllers embedded in the different body parts which only have access to local sensory information and which coordinate through the effects of physical actions mediated by the external environment through the emission/detection of signals which diffuse locally in space. The analysis of evolved creatures shows how they display effective morphology and control mechanisms which allow them to walk effectively and robustly both on regular and irregular terrains in all the replications of the experiment. Moreover, the obtained results show how the possibility to develop such skills can be improved by also selecting individuals on the basis of a task-independent component which reward them for the ability to coordinate the movements of their parts.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental challenge for any general theory of neural circuits is how to characterize the structure of the space of all possible circuits over a given model neuron. As a first step in this direction, this letter begins a systematic study of the global parameter space structure of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs), a class of neural models that is simple but dynamically universal. First, we explicitly compute the local bifurcation manifolds of CTRNNs. We then visualize the structure of these manifolds in net input space for small circuits. These visualizations reveal a set of extremal saddle node bifurcation manifolds that divide CTRNN parameter space into regions of dynamics with different effective dimensionality. Next, we completely characterize the combinatorics and geometry of an asymptotically exact approximation to these regions for circuits of arbitrary size. Finally, we show how these regions can be used to calculate estimates of the probability of encountering different kinds of dynamics in CTRNN parameter space.},

In this article, I will review research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only simple, low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed.},
