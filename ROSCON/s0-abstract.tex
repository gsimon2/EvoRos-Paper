\abstract{
We introduce {\project}, a framework combining evolutionary search and ROS/Gazebo-based simulation.
%
The framework provides researchers in evolutionary robotics access to the extensive support for real-world components and capabilities developed by the ROS community.
%
Conversely, {\project} enables developers in the ROS community, and more broadly robotics researchers, to take advantage of evolutionary search during design.
%
Evolutionary algorithms can be applied to many aspects of development, including optimal configuration and placement of sensors and actuators, generation of compensatory behavior in case of failed/faulty components, and detection of ``unlikely-but-possible'' situations that might cause system failure.}
