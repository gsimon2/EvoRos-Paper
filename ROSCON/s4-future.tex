\paragraph{Goals for ROSCon.}
In a ROSCon session, we will describe the current structure of {\project}, show how we addressed key integration issues, and present results of evolved behaviors and physical structures.  
%
Our primary goal is to provide the ROS community with a new tool to support and extend their own research and development.  
%
Although thus far we have focused on terrestrial robots, the integration of Ardupilot and MAVProxy means {\project} can be directly applied to a variety of other autonomous vehicles, including copters and planes.
%
In addition, we hope to stimulate discussion of open issues and identify possible future collaborations.
\clearpage
Sample implementations of a Roomba-like robot and Ardupilot-based simulation are available
here: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://github.com/jaredmoore/ros_gazebo_python}
\item \url{https://github.com/gsimon2/ros_catkin_ws_src/} 
\end{itemize}
%
These instances are currently under development, but we will have ready-to-run demos included in these repositories by the time of presentation at ROSCon.
